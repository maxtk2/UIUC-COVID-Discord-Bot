# UIUC COVID Discord Bot
## Author: Max Knutson

This is a simple bot that retrieves data from the UIUC COVID-19 Statistics website and displays them in Discord.

Commands:
-ping: Prints the ping of the bot.
-data: Prints an embed containing up-to-date COVID data from the website.

Installations used were Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and Discord APIs.
